# Mandelbrot
Interactive mandelbrot viewer created using WebGL and JavaScript. <br>
Host `index.html` on your local machine to use it. This program requires WebGL to run, but this is installed automatically with most modern browsers.<br>
Some code in this repository comes from the MDN web docs webGL examples.

This program is an evolution of the CPU-based version at https://github.com/BagelDogM/mandelbrot-python.
